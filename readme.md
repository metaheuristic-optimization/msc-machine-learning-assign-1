## Pre-requisites

You need to have the following packages installed

- pandas
- numpy

## Classification

#### How to run the classification model?

```
python main-classification.py
```

#### How to change hyper parameters for the classification model?

You can edit the `main-classification.py` file to set the hyper parameters. Instructions are outlined in the main-classification.py file

#### How to get best hyper parameters?

I have created a brute force algorithm to get the best parameters. This can be found in `best-hyperparams-classification.py`

To run this you can use the following command

```
python best-hyperparams-classification.py
```

Note this can take a long time to run depending on your hardware

## Regression

#### How to run the regression model?

```
python main-regression.py
```

#### How to change hyper parameters for the regression model?

You can edit the `main-regression.py` file to set the hyper parameters. Instructions are outlined in the main-regression.py file
